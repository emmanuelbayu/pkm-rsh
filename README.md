## Hello!

This is my project for Program Kreativitas Mahasiswa(PKM) - Riset Sosio Humaniora\
\
We created a research about how is the people's reaction to the government decision during January until March 2021. We gather data from social media called Twitter. We are trying to know how are people's sentiments frow the tweets they have made that specifically mentions @jokowi and @dpr_ri in twitter.\
\
This repo mainly shows about how to collect data using twint, process the tweets using pandas, and figuring out the sentiment of tweets using pretrained model called indoNLU. Credit for indobenchmark for creating indoNLU
